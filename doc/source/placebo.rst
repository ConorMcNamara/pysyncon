Placebo Tests
=============

A placebo test is used to assess the significance of a synthetic control study
by running the study once for each control unit set as treated unit and the
remaining control units set as controls. See :cite:`germany2015` (section I.B)
for a motivation. An example of usage is in the python notebook reproducing
the weights from that paper in the package repository
`here <https://github.com/sdfordham/pysyncon/tree/main/examples/basque.ipynb>`_
